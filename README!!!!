The implementation is quick-and-dirty. If someone has time to make it better, there are a lot of things to do.


1. You need to download Graphviz to render diagrams online http://graphviz.org
2. You need to configure local paths to graphviz in umladdon\acceleratoraddon\web\src\com\epam\controllers\pages\graphviz\GraphViz.java 

	//private static String TEMP_DIR = "/tmp";	// Linux
	private static String TEMP_DIR = "c:/temp";	// Windows

	/**
	 * Where is your dot program located? It will be called externally.
	 */
	//private static String DOT = "/usr/local/bin/dot"; // MAC
	//private static String DOT = "/usr/bin/dot";	// Linux
	private static String DOT = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Graphviz2.38\\bin\\dot.exe";	// Windows


3. You need to change paths for temporary files in GenerateGraph.java

    private static final String TEMP_PATH = "c:\\temp\\graph."; //Windows


TO DO:

1. rewrite 50% of code, because the existing implementation is quick and dirty, proof of concept
2. enums doesn't work.  It would be nice to show them.
